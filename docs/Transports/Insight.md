# Insight  
Insight is a simple Socket Server for Unity. It uses Mirror to create a simple net connection that can run at the same time as a NetworkManager. It can also be its own standalone network connection. The original goal of this project was to create a secondary connection to allow a MasterServer. It can be used for that or many other things. The InsightServer can run on its own or with modules.
