# Telepathy

Simple, message based, MMO Scale TCP networking in C\#. And no magic.

Telepathy was designed with the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) in mind. Telepathy is fast and extremely reliable, designed for [MMO] scale Networking. Telepathy uses framing, so anything sent will be received the same way. Telepathy is raw C\# and can be used in Unity3D too.
