# Network Lobby Manager

\*\*Please see the Lobby example in the Examples folder in your Mirror folder

The Network Lobby Manager is a specialized type of [Network Manager](NetworkManager) that provides a multiplayer lobby before entering the main play scene of the game. It allows you to set up a network with:

-   A maximum player limit

-   Automatic start when all players are ready

-   Option to prevent players from joining a game in progress

-   Customizable ways for players to choose options while in lobby  

There are two types of player objects with the Network Lobby Manager:

**Lobby Player Prefab**

-   One for each player

-   Created when client connects, or player is added

-   Persists until client disconnects

-   Holds ready flag and configuration data

-   Handles commands in the lobby

-   Must use the [Network Lobby Player](NetworkLobbyPlayer) component

**Player Prefab**

-   One for each player

-   Created when game scene is started

-   Destroyed when leaving game scene

-   Handles commands in the game
