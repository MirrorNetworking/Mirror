# Contribution Guide

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make it such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project itself.

### I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

We currently allow our users to use the issue tracker for support questions. But please be wary that maintaining an open source project can take a lot of time from the maintainers. If asking for a support question, state it clearly and take the time to explain your problem properly. Also, if your problem is not strictly related to this project we recommend you to use Stack Overlow instead.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing bug reports as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on the project's repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you used the project. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. It's always better to get more information. You can include links to files or GitHub projects, copy/pasteable snippets or even print screens or animated GIFS. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of the project are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Any other information that could be useful about you environment**
