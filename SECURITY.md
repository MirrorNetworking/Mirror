We will keep you updated on our steps to mitigate issues every 2-4 weeks.

## Timelines
- Critical vulnerabilities can be expected to be patched within 1-2 weeks.
- Medium risk vulnerabilities can be expected to be patched within 2-3 weeks.
- Low risk vulnerabilities will be patched within 3-4 weeks.

## Bug Bounty
Depending on the severity of the exploit, we offer a $50 - $500 bug bounty.

**Specifically we are looking for:**
* Ways to crash a Mirror server.
* Ways to exploit a Mirror server.
* Ways to leave a Mirror server in undefined state.

We are **not** looking for DOS/DDOS attacks, as those are expected to be handled by the hosting infrastructure. 

## Notifications
In case of security breaches, Mirror users will be informed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/N9QVxbM) and release changelogs.
Since we collect no user data, you are recommended to read the changelog and follow our Discord announcements.
