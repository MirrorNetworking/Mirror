# Transports Overview

Mirror is a high level Networking Library that can use several different low level transports. To use a transport, simply add it as component to the NetworkManager and drag it into the NetworkManager's Transport field.

-   [TCP - Telepathy](Telepathy.md) Simple, message based, MMO Scale TCP networking in C\#. And no magic.

-   [TCP - Apathy](https://mirror-networking.com/apathy/) Apathy is a fast, lightweight, allocation-free low level TCP library for Unity developed by vis2k. Apathy was developed in native C for maximum MMO Scale networking performance.

-   [WebGL - WebSockets](WebSockets.md) WebSockets transport layer for Mirror that target WebGL clients, without relying on Unity's stodgy old LLAPI.

-   [Multiplexer](Multiplexer.md) Multiplexer is a bridging transport to allow a server to handle clients on different transports concurrently, for example desktop clients using Telepathy together with WebGL clients using Websockets.

-   [Fallback](Fallback.md) Fallback is a compatibility transport for transports that don't run on all platforms and need fallback options to cover all other platforms.

-   [Discord](Discord.md) Discord Transport is a networking transport that enables sending networking packets via [Discord's Game SDK](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide).

-   [UDP - Ignorance](Ignorance.md) Ignorance implements a reliable and unreliable sequenced UDP transport based on ENet.

-   [UDP - LiteNetLib4Mirror](LiteNetLib4Mirror.md) LiteNetLib4Mirror implements a UDP transport based on LiteNetLib with Network Discovery and uPnP included.

-   [Steam - Fizzy](Fizzy.md) A complete rebuild utilising Async (Previously SteamNetNetworkTransport) of a Steam P2P network transport layer.
