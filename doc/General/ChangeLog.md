# Change Log

**Mirror is published to the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) at the start of every month, unless some critical issue causes a delay.**

Mirror uses semantic versioning, and the versions shown here are those that were published to the Asset Store, and occasionally major version bumps happen mid-month between store submissions and are therefore not individually shown here.
