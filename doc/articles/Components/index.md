    The Network Manager HUD is a quick-start tool to help you start building your multiplayer game straight away, without first having to build a user interface for game creation/connection/joining. It allows you to jump straight into your gameplay programming, and means you can build your own version of these controls later in your development schedule.
-   [NetworkIdentity](NetworkIdentity.md)  
    The Network Identity component is at the heart of the Mirror networking high-level API. It controls a game object’s unique identity on the network, and it uses that identity to make the networking system aware of the game object. It offers two different options for configuration and they are mutually exclusive, which means either one of the options or none can be checked.

    The Network Proximity Checker component controls the visibility of game objects for network clients, based on proximity to players.
-   [NetworkTransform](NetworkTransform.md)  
    The Network Transform component synchronizes the movement and rotation of game objects across the network. Note that the network Transform component only synchronizes spawned networked game objects.
-   [NetworkTransformChild](NetworkTransformChild.md)  
    The Network Transform Child component synchronizes the position and rotation of the child game object of a game object with a Network Transform component.
