This guide currently shows you:
- [Basic scene setup](#part-1)
- [Player movement](#part-4)
- [Names and colours](#part-8)
- [Scene script with canvas buttons](#part-11)
- [Weapon switching](#part-12)

It is best to first make a mini practice game before converting your single player game, or creating your ideal brand new multiplayer.

The Pre-made Mirror examples are great for using as reference, it is recommend to use them regarding connection setup, with ports and firewalls. This can be a huge topic that changes from person to person, and is not covered in this guide, here we will use localHost (multiple games on same PC).



## Part 1

Blank Project, import Mirror from [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321).



## Part 2

- Create new scene, save it, and add it to build settings
- Create a new GameObject, name it NetworkManager in the scene, and add these 3 components
    - NetworkManager
    - TelepathyTransport
    - NetworkManagerHUD
- On the NetworkManager component, drag your Offline and Online scene into the slots, we have only one scene
for now, so put your scene in both
    - The scene must be in the build settings before dragging it to the field

## Part 3

Setup the scene
- Add a simple Plane floor with: 
    - positions (0, -1, 0)
    - scale (2, 2, 2)
- (optional) add a material to this, I added one called dirt that is used one of mirrors examples
- Next we add a GameObject, name does not matter
- Add `NetworkStartPosition` component to this GameObject
- Duplicate the GameObject a few times, and scatter around your scene floor so that you have multiple spawn points. I did 4, one near each corner

![](./image--002.jpg)


## Part 4

Creating the player
- Create a capsule using the menus as shown in the image
- Attached a NetworkTransform component, this will auto add a Network Identity
- Tick Client Authority on the NetworkTransform

![](./image--003.jpg)

- Rename that object Player
- Add an empty PlayerScript
- Drag into Project to create a prefab
- Then delete Player from scene

![](./image--004.jpg)

- Drag your player prefab into Network manager,
- Set spawn method to Round Robin.

## Part 5

Add the following to your PlayerScript.
```cs
using Mirror;
using UnityEngine;

namespace QuickStart
{
    public class PlayerScript : NetworkBehaviour
    {
        public override void OnStartLocalPlayer()
        {
            Camera.main.transform.SetParent(transform);
            Camera.main.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
        }

        void Update()
        {
            if (!isLocalPlayer) { return; }

            float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * 110.0f;
            float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * 4f;

            transform.Rotate(0, moveX, 0);
            transform.Translate(0, 0, moveZ);
        }
    }
}
```


## Part 6

Press play in Unity editor, and then Host (server + client) button in the game window. You should be able to move around with a first person view capsule.

![](./image--006.jpg)



## Part 7

Build and run your scene, open it, host on one, and press the Client button on the other. Congrats you made a mini multiplayer game!

![](./image--007.jpg)



## Part 8

Player name above heads
- Inside your player Prefab, create an empty GameObject
- name it something like `FloatingInfo`
    - position Y to 1.5 
    - scale X to -1
- Inside that `FloatingInfo`, create a 3D text using Unity menu (GameObject - 3D Object - 3D Text),
- Set it up as shown in the picture below

![](./image--008.jpg)



## Part 9

Update your PlayerScript.cs with this:
```cs
using Mirror;
using UnityEngine;

namespace QuickStart
{
    public class PlayerScript : NetworkBehaviour
    {
        public TextMesh playerNameText;
        public GameObject floatingInfo;

        private Material playerMaterialClone;

        [SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnNameChanged))]
        public string playerName;

        [SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnColorChanged))]
        public Color playerColor = Color.white;

        void OnNameChanged(string _Old, string _New)
        {
            playerNameText.text = playerName;
        }

        void OnColorChanged(Color _Old, Color _New)
        {
            playerNameText.color = _New;
            playerMaterialClone = new Material(GetComponent<Renderer>().material);
            playerMaterialClone.color = _New;
            GetComponent<Renderer>().material = playerMaterialClone;
        }

        public override void OnStartLocalPlayer()
        {
            Camera.main.transform.SetParent(transform);
            Camera.main.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
            
            floatingInfo.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, -0.3f, 0.6f);
            floatingInfo.transform.localScale = new Vector3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f);

            string name = "Player" + Random.Range(100, 999);
            Color color = new Color(Random.Range(0f, 1f), Random.Range(0f, 1f), Random.Range(0f, 1f))
            CmdSetupPlayer(name, color);
        }

        [Command]
        public void CmdSetupPlayer(string _name, Color _col)
        {
            // player info sent to server, then server updates sync vars which handles it on all clients
            playerName = _name;
            playerColor = _col;
        }

        void Update()
        {
            if (!isLocalPlayer)
            {
                // make non-local players run this
                floatingInfo.transform.LookAt(Camera.main.transform);
                return;
            }

            float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * 110.0f;
            float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * 4f;

            transform.Rotate(0, moveX, 0);
            transform.Translate(0, 0, moveZ);
        }
    }
}
```



## Part 10

Add the `PlayerNameText` and `FloatingInfo` objects into the script on the player prefab, as shown below.

![](./image--009.jpg)

Now if you build and run, host on one, join on the other, you will see player names and colors synced across the network! 

Well done, 5 stars to you!

![](./image--010.jpg)



## Part 11

A scene networked object all can access and adjust.

Create a SceneScript.cs, add it onto an empty GameObject in the scene called SceneScript.

Then create a Canvas with text and button, similar to below.

![](./image--011.jpg)

Add the sceneScript variable, Awake function, and CmdSendPlayerMessage to PlayerScript.cs
Also add the new playerName joined line to CmdSetupPlayer();
```cs
private SceneScript sceneScript;

void Awake()
{
    //allow all players to run this
    sceneScript = GameObject.FindObjectOfType<SceneScript>();
}
[Command]
public void CmdSendPlayerMessage()
{
    if (sceneScript) 
    { 
        sceneScript.statusText = $"{playerName} says hello {Random.Range(10, 99)}";
    }
}
[Command]
public void CmdSetupPlayer(string _name, Color _col)
{
    //player info sent to server, then server updates sync vars which handles it on all clients
    playerName = _name;
    playerColor = _col;
    sceneScript.statusText = $"{playerName} joined.";
}
public override void OnStartLocalPlayer()
{
    sceneScript.playerScript = this;
    //. . . . ^ new line to add here
```

Add this code to SceneScript.cs

```cs
using Mirror;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

namespace QuickStart
{
    public class SceneScript : NetworkBehaviour
    {
        public Text canvasStatusText;
        public PlayerScript playerScript;

        [SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnStatusTextChanged))]
        public string statusText;

        void OnStatusTextChanged(string _Old, string _New)
        {
            //called from sync var hook, to update info on screen for all players
            canvasStatusText.text = statusText;
        }

        public void ButtonSendMessage()
        {
            if (playerScript != null)  
            {
                playerScript.CmdSendPlayerMessage();
            }
        }
    }
}
```


- Attach the ButtonSendMessage function to your Canvas Button.
- Attach Canvas Scene Text to SceneScript variable.
    - ignore SceneScriptâ€™s, playerScript variable, it automatically sets this!

![](./image--012.jpg) 
![](./image--013.jpg)

Now if you build and run, host and join, you can send messages, and have a text log for actions!

Wahooo!

![](./image--014.jpg)
![](./image--015.jpg)

Experiment and adjust, have fun!

## Part 12

Weapon switching! The code bits.

Add the following to your PlayerScript.cs
```cs
private int selectedWeaponLocal = 1;
public GameObject[] weaponArray;

[SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnWeaponChanged))]
public int activeWeaponSynced;

void OnWeaponChanged(int _Old, int _New)
{
    // disable old weapon
    // in range and not null
    if (0 < _Old && _Old < weaponArray.Length && weaponArray[_Old] != null)
    {
        weaponArray[_Old].SetActive(false);
    }
    
    // enable new weapon
    // in range and not null
    if (0 < _New && _New < weaponArray.Length && weaponArray[_New] != null)
    {
        weaponArray[_New].SetActive(true);
    }
}

[Command]
public void CmdChangeActiveWeapon(int newIndex)
{
    activeWeaponSynced = newIndex;
}

void Awake() 
{
    // disable all weapons
    foreach (var item in weaponArray)
    {
        if (item != null)
        { 
            item.SetActive(false); 
        }
    }
}
```
Add the weapon switch button in update. Only local player switches its own weapon, so it goes below the `!isLocalPlayer` check.
```cs
void Update()
{
    if (!isLocalPlayer)
    {
        // make non-local players run this
        floatingInfo.transform.LookAt(Camera.main.transform);
        return;
    }

    float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * 110.0f;
    float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * 4f;

    transform.Rotate(0, moveX, 0);
    transform.Translate(0, 0, moveZ);

    if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire2")) //Fire2 is mouse 2nd click and left alt
    {
        selectedWeaponLocal += 1;

        if (selectedWeaponLocal > weaponArray.Length) 
        {
            selectedWeaponLocal = 1; 
        }

        CmdChangeActiveWeapon(selectedWeaponLocal);
    }
}
```



## Part 13

Weapon models

Add the basic cube weapons first, change these later.

- Double click your player prefab to enter it
- Add a "WeaponsHolder" empty GameObject, with position and rotation at 0,0,0.
- Inside that GameObject, create a cube from unity menu, (GameObject, 3D object, cube)- Remove the box colliders.
- Rename this `Weapon1`, change position and scale to match the below pictures.

![](./image--017.jpg)

Duplicate weapon 1 for a Weapon 2, and change its scale and position, now you should have 2 different looking â€˜weaponsâ€™!

![](./image--018.jpg)


## Part 14

Weapon switch finale.

- Add these 2 GameObjects to your PlayerScript.cs weapons array.
- Disable weapon 2, so only weapon 1 shows when spawning.

![](./image--019.jpg)

Build and run!

You should see each player switching weapons, and whatever your player has equipped, will auto show on new joining players (sync var and hook magic!)
