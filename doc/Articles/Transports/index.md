# Transports Overview

Mirror is a high level Networking Library that can use several different low level transports. To use a transport, simply add it as component to the NetworkManager and drag it into the NetworkManager's Transport field.

-   [TCP - Telepathy](Telepathy.md) Simple, message based, MMO Scale TCP networking in C\#. And no magic.

-   [TCP - Apathy](https://mirror-networking.com/apathy/) Apathy is a fast, lightweight, allocation-free low level TCP library for Unity developed by vis2k. Apathy was developed in native C for maximum MMO Scale networking performance.

-   [TCP - Booster](https://mirror-networking.com/booster/) The Mirror Booster uncorks your multiplayer game by moving the Networking load out of Unity!

-   [WebSockets - SimpleWebTransport](SimpleWebTransport.md) WebSockets transport layer for Mirror that target WebGL clients.

-   [Multiplexer](Multiplexer.md) Multiplexer is a bridging transport to allow a server to handle clients on different transports concurrently, for example desktop clients using Telepathy together with WebGL clients using Websockets.

-   [Fallback](Fallback.md) Fallback is a compatibility transport for transports that don't run on all platforms and need fallback options to cover all other platforms.

-   [UDP - Ignorance](Ignorance.md) Ignorance implements a reliable and unreliable sequenced UDP transport based on ENet.

-   [UDP - LiteNetLibTransport](LiteNetLibTransport.md) LiteNetLibTransport implements a UDP transport based on [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib).

-   [Steam - FizzySteamworks](FizzySteamworks.md) Transport utilising Steam P2P network, building on Steamworks.NET.

-   [Steam - FizzyFacepunch](FizzyFacepunch.md) Transport utilising Steam P2P network, building on Facepunch.Steamworks.
