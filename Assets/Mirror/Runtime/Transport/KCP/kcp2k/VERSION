V1.7 [2021-01-13]
- fix: unreliable messages reset timeout now too
- perf: KcpConnection OnCheckEnabled callback changed to a simple 'paused' boolean.
  This is faster than invoking a Func<bool> every time and allows us to fix #8 more
  easily later by calling .Pause/.Unpause from OnEnable/OnDisable in MirrorTransport.
- fix #8: Unpause now resets timeout to fix a bug where Mirror would pause kcp,
  change the scene which took >10s, then unpause and kcp would detect the lack of
  any messages for >10s as timeout. Added test to make sure it never happens again.
- MirrorTransport: statistics logging for headless servers
- Mirror Transport: Send/Receive window size increased once more from 2048 to 4096.

V1.6 [2021-01-10]
- Unreliable channel added!
- perf: KcpHeader byte added to every kcp message to indicate
  Handshake/Data/Ping/Disconnect instead of scanning each message for Hello/Byte/Ping
  content via SegmentEquals. It's a lot cleaner, should be faster and should avoid
  edge cases where a message content would equal Hello/Ping/Bye sequence accidentally.
- Kcp.Input: offset moved to parameters for cases where it's needed
- Kcp.SetMtu from original Kcp.c

V1.5 [2021-01-07]
- KcpConnection.MaxSend/ReceiveRate calculation based on the article
- MirrorTransport: large send/recv window size defaults to avoid high latencies caused
  by packets not being processed fast enough
- MirrorTransport: show MaxSend/ReceiveRate in debug gui
- MirrorTransport: don't Log.Info to console in headless mode if debug log is disabled

V1.4 [2020-11-27]
- fix: OnCheckEnabled added. KcpConnection message processing while loop can now
  be interrupted immediately. fixes Mirror Transport scene changes which need to stop
  processing any messages immediately after a scene message)
- perf: Mirror KcpTransport: FastResend enabled by default. turbo mode according to:
  https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md#protocol-configuration
- perf: Mirror KcpTransport: CongestionControl disabled by default (turbo mode)

V1.3 [2020-11-17]
- Log.Info/Warning/Error so logging doesn't depend on UnityEngine anymore
- fix: Server.Tick catches SocketException which happens if Android client is killed
- MirrorTransport: debugLog option added that can be checked in Unity Inspector
- Utils.Clamp so Kcp.cs doesn't depend on UnityEngine
- Utils.SegmentsEqual: use Linq SequenceEqual so it doesn't depend on UnityEngine
=> kcp2k can now be used in any C# project even without Unity

V1.2 [2020-11-10]
- more tests added
- fix: raw receive buffers are now all of MTU size
- fix: raw receive detects error where buffer was too small for msgLength and
  result in excess data being dropped silently
- KcpConnection.MaxMessageSize added for use in high level
- KcpConnection.MaxMessageSize increased from 1200 bytes to to maximum allowed
  message size of 145KB for kcp (based on mtu, overhead, wnd_rcv)

V1.1 [2020-10-30]
- high level cleanup, fixes, improvements

V1.0 [2020-10-22]
- Kcp.cs now mirrors original Kcp.c behaviour
  (this fixes dozens of bugs)

V0.1
- initial kcp-csharp based version
