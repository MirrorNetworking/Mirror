// PredictedRigidbody which stores & indidvidually rewinds history per Rigidbody.
//
// This brings significant performance savings because:
// - if a scene has 1000 objects
// - and a player interacts with say 3 objects at a time
// - Physics.Simulate() would resimulate 1000 objects
// - where as this component only resimulates the 3 changed objects
//
// The downside is that history rewinding is done manually via Vector math,
// instead of real physics. It's not 100% correct - but it sure is fast!
