### BREAKING CHANGES

* It is no longer guaranteed that all objects are spawned before we start calling events

* fix object spawning on scene change

* remove unused variable

* rename localClientActive to LocalClientActive
* Spawn no longer receives NetworkClient
* Remove obsolete OnServerAddPlayer

Any person that overrides this method has a broken game.  These methods are never called anywhere.

The user gets a warning because they are overriding an obsolete method,  which might get ignored if they have lots of other warnings.   They would run their game and their game would not work at all.  No errors.

By removing these methods, users that override these methods will get a compile time error instead.  So they cannot ignore this error and they will fix it.

* Method is no longer available in NetworkLobbyManager
* Make NetworkClient Great Again!
