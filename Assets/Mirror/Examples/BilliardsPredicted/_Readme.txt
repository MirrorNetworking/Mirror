Advanced multiplayer Billiards demo with Prediction.
Mouse drag the white ball to apply force.

If you are a beginner, start with the basic Billiards demo instead.
If you are advanced, this demo shows how to use Mirror's prediction features for physics / FPS games.

The demo is work in progress.
At the moment, this is only for the Mirror team to test individual prediction features!

Notes:
- Red/White ball Rigidbody CollisionMode needs to be ContinousDynamic to avoid white flying through red sometimes.
  even 'Continous' is not enough, we need ContinousDynamic.
