# Basic Example

This is a bare bones example of a running game with Network Manager and UI prefab players:

1.  Remove all scenes from Build Settings, then add the Example scene alone.

2.  Open the Example scene and build the project.

3.  In the editor, click Play, and LAN Host or LAN Server...it will be listening on port 7777.  
    - If you clicked LAN Host, the host player will appear as Player 00.

4.  Run one or more instances (up to 16 total players) of the built application.

5.  Click LAN Client on each instance.

6.  Now you will see all players in the editor and the clients, all with data being updated and synchronized.
