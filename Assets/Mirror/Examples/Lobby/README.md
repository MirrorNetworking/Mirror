# Lobby Example

In Buld Settings, remove all scenes and add all of the scenes from the Examples\Lobbey\Scenes folder in the following order:

-	Offline
-	Lobby
-	Online

If you opened the Lobby scene before doing the above steps, you may have to reassign the scenes to the NetworkLobbyManagerExt component of the LobbyManager scene object.

** Do not assign anything to the Online scene field!**  If you do, the lobby will be bypassed.  Assign **only* the Offline and Lobby and Gameplay scene fields in the inspector.

Start up to 4 built instances:  These will all be client players.

Open the Offline scene in the Editor and press Play

Click the Join Game and LAN Host in the editor: This will be host and the 5th player.  You can also use LAN Server if you prefer.

Click Join Game and LAN Client in the built instances.
