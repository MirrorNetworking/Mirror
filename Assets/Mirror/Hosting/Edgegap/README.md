# Edgegap Unity plugin for Dedicated Servers quickstart

This plugin has been tested, and supports Unity versions 2021.2+, including all LTS releases, Unity 2023, and Unity 6.

This plugin is intended to help you:
- get started quickly with Dedicated Servers on Edgegap,
- make your server build iteration as fast as possible,
- make multiplayer development 10x easier by removing the need to learn Linux, Docker, or Cloud concepts.

This plugin does not need to be included in your builds, as it's only a development tool and does not have any runtime features.

### Usage requirements

To take full advantage of our Unity plugin's build features, you will need to:

- [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker CLI),

### Update the Plugin in Unity

If you've installed using git, to update our plugin, locate it in Unity's **Package Manager** window and click **Update**. Wait for the process to complete and you're good to go!

If you've installed by copying, you will have to remove the Edgegap folder and paste the newer copy. Your settings are saved in your Unity version, so they shouldn't be lost in this process.
