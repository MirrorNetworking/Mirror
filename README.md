## Architecture
The **Server & Client** are **ONE project** in order to achieve maximum productivity.

Simply use **NetworkBehaviour** instead of **MonoBehaviour**.

Making multiplayer games this way is fun & easy:

```cs
public class Player : NetworkBehaviour
{
    // Synced automatically
    [SyncVar] public int health = 100;
    
    // Lists, Dictionaries, Sets too
    SyncList<Item> inventory = new SyncList<Item>();
    
    // Server/Client-only code
    [Server] void LevelUp() {}
    [Client] void Animate() {}
    
    void Update()
    {
        // isServer/isClient for runtime checks
        if (isServer) Heal();
        if (isClient) Move();
    }
    
    // Zero overhead remote calls
    [Command]   void CmdUseItem(int slot) {} // Client to Server
    [ClientRpc] void RpcRespawn() {}         // Server to all Clients
    [TargetRpc] void Hello() {}              // Server to one Client
}
```

There's also **NetworkServer** & **NetworkClient**.</br>
And that's about it 🤩
