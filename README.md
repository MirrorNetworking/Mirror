Mirror is a **high level** Networking API for Unity, built on top of the **low level** [Telepathy](https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy) library.

Mirror is built [and tested](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQqf_iqOLlBRTUqqyor_OUx_rHlYx-SYvZWMvHGuLIuRuxJ-qX3s8JzrrBB5vxDdGfl-HhYZW3g5lLW/pub#h.h4wha2mpetsc) for **MMO Scale** Networking by the developers of [uMMORPG](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/51212), [uSurvival](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/95015) and [Cubica](https://cubica.net).

Mirror is optimized for **ease of use** and **probability of success**. Projects that use Mirror are small, concise and maintainable. uMMORPG was possible with <6000 lines of code. We needed a networking library that allows us to [launch our games](https://ummorpg.net/showcase/), period.

With Mirror, the **Server & Client are ONE** project _(hence the name)_. Instead of having one code base for the server and one for the client, we simply use the same code for both of them.
* `[Server]` / `[Client]` tags can be used for the server-only and client-only parts.
* `[Command]` are used for Client->Server, and `[ClientRpc]` / `[TargetRpc]` for Server->Client communication.
* `[SyncVar]`s and `SyncList`s are used to automatically synchronize state.

What previously required **10.000** lines of code, now takes **1.000** lines of code. Therein lies the **magic of Mirror**.

_Note: Mirror is based on Unity's abandoned UNET Networking system. We fixed it up and pushed it to MMO Scale._

## Documentation
Check out our [Documentation](https://vis2k.github.io/Mirror/) and read the [Wiki](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror/wiki).

The main difference is that you have to use `using Mirror;` instead of `using UnityEngine.Networking;` at the top of your scripts.

_Oh, and you won't have to worry about channels, low level networking, [packet loss](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unet-deprecation-thread.543501/page-3#post-3597869), [lack of support](https://forum.unity.com/threads/is-hlapi-dead.517436/) or [bugs](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unet-networkwriter-dot-write-causing-readstring-slash-readbytes-out-of-range-errors-in-clients) ever again. Mirror just works._

## Usage Guide

**If you are coming from a current UNET implementation or are seeking the stable version:**

Import mirror from the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/129321) into your project.

**Alternatively, you can install new releases manually:**

*Note: New releases are bleeding edge and may come with undiscovered bugs. Use at your own risk!*

1. [Download Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror/releases) (for Unity 2018.2.20 or 2018.3.x).
2. Decompress the zip file in Assets

## Migration Guide
If you are still using UNET and want to switch to Mirror, you should check out our [Migration Guide](https://vis2k.github.io/Mirror/General/Migration). Don't panic, it's very easy and won't take more than 5 minutes.

## Example Projects
Download Mirror from the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/129321), we have several small example projects included.

For a fully polished complete project example, consider [uMMORPG](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/51212) or [uSurvival](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/95015).
