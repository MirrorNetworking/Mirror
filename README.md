## Mirror Networking 
The **#1** free **open source** game networking library for **Unity 2019 / 2020 / 2021**.

Used **in production** by major hits like [**Population: ONE**](https://www.populationonevr.com/) and many [more](#made-with-mirror).

Originally based on [**UNET**](https://blog.unity.com/technology/announcing-unet-new-unity-multiplayer-technology): battle tested **since 2014** for 8 years and counting!

Mirror is **[stable](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/general/tests)**, [**modular**](#low-level-transports) & **[easy to use](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/)** for all types of games, even small [MMORPGs](#made-with-mirror) üéÆ.

**Made in üá©üá™üá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüá∏üá¨üáπüáº with ‚ù§Ô∏è**.

---
## Architecture
The **Server & Client** are **ONE project** in order to achieve maximum productivity.

Simply use **NetworkBehaviour** instead of **MonoBehaviour**.

Making multiplayer games this way is fun & easy:

```cs
public class Player : NetworkBehaviour
{
    // synced automatically
    [SyncVar] public int health = 100;
    
    // lists, dictionaries, sets too
    SyncList<Item> inventory = new SyncList<Item>();
    
    // server/client-only code
    [Server] void LevelUp() {}
    [Client] void Animate() {}
    
    void Update()
    {
        // isServer/isClient for runtime checks
        if (isServer) Heal();
        if (isClient) Move();
    }
    
    // zero overhead remote calls
    [Command]   void CmdUseItem(int slot) {} // client to server
    [Rpc]       void RpcRespawn() {}         // server to all clients
    [TargetRpc] void Hello() {}              // server to one client
}
```

There's also **NetworkServer** & **NetworkClient**. And that's about it ü§©.

## Development & Contributing
Mirror is used **in production** by everything from small indie projects to million dollar funded games that will run for a decade or more.

We prefer to work slow & thoroughly in order to not break everyone's games üêå.

Therefore, we need to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) üòó.

# Bug Bounty

A lot of projects use Mirror in production. If you found a critical bug / exploit in Mirror core, please reach out to us in private.
Depending on the severity of the exploit, we offer $50 - $500 for now.
Rewards based on Mirror's [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/vis2k), capped at amount of donations we received that month.

**Specifically we are looking for:**
* Ways to crash a Mirror server
* Ways to exploit a Mirror server
* Ways to leave a Mirror server in undefined state

We are **not** looking for DOS/DDOS attacks. The exploit should be possible with just a couple of network packets, and it should be reproducible.

**Credits / past findings / fixes:**
* 2020, fholm: fuzzing ConnectMessage to stop further connects [[#2397](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror/pull/2397)]
