  Title: Check Documentation
  Description: If your asset contains any code (scripts, shaders) - we ask that you
    include offline documentation in the format of pdf or rtf with your submission,
    as it is mandatory for all packages that include scripts or other components
    that require set up. Your documentation must be organized with a table of contents
    and numbered, written in English and have no grammar mistakes. Create a setup
    guide with a step-by-step tutorial (pdf or video), as well as a script reference
    if users will need to do any coding. If your asset contains art (3D models, sprites)
    and you used code to set up a demo scene, you may skip this step.
