  Title: Remove Lossy Audio Files
  Description: 'We do not recommend audio files that are saved as .mp3 or .ogg. Please
    save all of your audio as lossless format file types, such as .wav. If you have
    non-lossy alternative files to your lossy audio files, please make sure to name
    them identically to avoid rejection. For example: ''shout.mp3'', ''shout.wav''.
    Listing of the format in the file name is also allowed and accounted for by the
    validator. For example: ''taunt MP3.mp3'', ''taunt WAV.wav''.'
