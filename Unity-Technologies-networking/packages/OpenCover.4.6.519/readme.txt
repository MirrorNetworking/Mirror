Welcome to OpenCover.

OpenCover is an open source (MIT licence) code coverage utility for all .NET 
Frameworks (2 and above, including Silverlight). It can handle all .NET 
languages as long as the compiled assemblies use the .NET Runtime.

It is most commonly used to gather coverage data of code that is being 
exercised by unit testing i.e. nunit, mstest etc. 

We recommend that you view the documents that have also been installed 
alongside the utility to get started or you can look at the documentation 
provided on the wiki https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover/wiki/Usage.

Currently OpenCover has no visualization of its results and we recommend that
your use ReportGenerator (2.1.8 and above) to view the results against your code.

A sample project showing a possible way to use OpenCover with ReportGenerator 
has also been provided for your convenience.  

If you have any issues or feature requests with OpenCover please raise them 
with the project owners on https://github.com/opencover/opencover.
